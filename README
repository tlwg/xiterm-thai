Using GNU autoconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.	./configure to generate config.h and the various Makefiles.
	Note this is the first attempt at GNU autoconfig, so minor
	hand-editing of Makefiles may be needed.

  2.	set the main preferences:
    	    Edit "src/feature.h"

	and (optionally) the default compile-time values:
	    Edit "src/defaults.h"

  3.	Build it (repeat step 2 as desired):
	    make

  4. 	Install xiterm:
	    make install

	you may also want to install etc/terminfo etc/termcap

  5.	If compiled with UTMP_SUPPORT, you'll have to install xiterm setuid
	root or setuid/setgid to match the file permissions on /etc/utmp

NB:     SunOS (with/without gcc?) gets reported by configure as

                #undef STDC_HEADERS
                #define HAVE_SYS_IOCTL_H 1

        but the ioctl() defines aren't protected against multiple
        inclusion, in this case by <termios.h> so use a hack in
        "feature.h" to avoid the problem.

        Gave up checking for `STDC_HEADERS', since they really should be
        there and I don't want to deal with the problems when they don't
        exist.

        SunOS users might complain to the right places and get their
        system headers fixed so that one day the rest of us won't have
        to keep compensating :(

        SVR4 users (that aren't using gcc) will have to add -DSVR4 to
        CPPFLAGS for configure.
