- Add a front-end config program

- Add midnight commander support for scroolbar

- Click-and-drag doesn't work for X11 mouse report overriding

- It'd be nice to have the scrollbar move when the arrows are pressed
  and to scroll continuously.

- Speed-up screen refreshes

- Add X11 mouse highlighting mode? (NOT LIKELY)

- Fix problem with pixel-droppings left when bold has been simulated
  using an overstrike. (NOT LIKELY)

- Make cleaner scrollbar updates?

- Fix configure to detect SVR4 and to handle install properly when it is
  found to be ./install.sh

- Add Unicode support

- Add support for spawning modules (like the way fvwm does).
  It should then be possible to make a standalone Tek or other graphics
  window and even some simple pop-up mouse menus that could communicate
  with rxvt, but not bloat its size.  Nice idea, but I'll never have time
  to even start, so eager volunteers would be nice.

- provide a way to hook the scrollbar for private use?
  eg, for easier scrolling with a standard text editor.
